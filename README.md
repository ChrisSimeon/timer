# What it is

An easy timer written in python.



# how to use

Start the timer with python and pass as argument the minutes it should run. Be aware, only whole numbers work, no floats. 

```
> python 3 ./Timer.py 3
```

Timer runs 3 minutes, plays the Alarm sound afterwards and then starts counting up until you end the program. 

While counting down you can restart the timer. Does not work after it finished counting down. Sorry. 

I wrote a simple .bat file to start the program with 25 minutes and I use it as Podomoro Timer. 

If somebody besides me is in fact using it and needs more basic functionality just ask me or write it yourself. 

Have fun.
